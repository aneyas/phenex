>The Thirty-Seventh Spirit is Phenex (or Pheynix). He is a great Marquis, and
>appeareth like the Bird Phoenix, having the Voice of a Child. He singeth many
>sweet notes before the Exorcist, which he must not regard, but by-and-by he
>must bid him put on Human Shape. Then he will speak marvellously of all
>wonderful Sciences if required. He is a Poet, good and excellent. And he will
>be willing to perform thy requests.  
>
>He hath hopes also to return to the Seventh Throne after 1,200 years more, as
>he said unto Solomon. He governeth 20 Legions of Spirits. And his Seal is this,
>which wear thou, etc.
>
> -- S.L. MacGregor Mathers
